# Time Series Data Visualization Using Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing time series data using Python. By leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`, the project demonstrates techniques for data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and decomposition to extract meaningful insights from temporal datasets.

## Installation

To replicate this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the necessary environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niharwani/TimeSeriesProject.git
   cd TimeSeriesDataVisualization
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Description

The project utilizes a time series dataset stored in `stock_data.csv`. The dataset should contain at least two columns:

- `Date`: The date or timestamp of the observation.
- `Value`: The numerical value corresponding to the date.

**Sample Structure:**

| Date       | Value |
|------------|-------|
| 2025-01-01 | 123   |
| 2025-01-02 | 150   |
| 2025-01-03 | 98    |
| ...        | ...   |

*Ensure that the 'Date' column is in a recognizable date format.*

## Usage

Follow the steps below to run the time series visualization script:

1. **Place the Dataset:**

   Ensure `data.csv` is located in the project directory.

2. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the Python script to generate visualizations:

   ```bash
   python time_series_visualization.py
   ```

   The script will perform the following:

   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Plot the original time series.
   - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Display the resulting plots for analysis.

## Results

Upon execution, the script produces several plots:

1. **Original Time Series Plot:**

2. **Decomposed Components:**

   - **Trend Component:**

     ![Trend Component](images/trend_component.png)

   - **Seasonal Component:**

     ![Seasonal Component](images/seasonal_component.png)

   - **Residual Component:**

     ![Residual Component](images/residual_component.png)

*Note: Ensure that the `images` directory contains the respective plot images.*
